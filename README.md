This project is about Image Classification in Machine Learning. 

It applies three different Keras Sequential models (one simple non-cnn and two cnn) on 
three different popular datasets (MNIST, FASHION MNIST and CIFAR 10), and compares the results.
The comparison and analysis focus on  
1. different type of the models, non-cnn vs cnn,
2. different complexity of the models, one convolution layer vs multiple layers,
3. same model on different datasets.

The source code is provided in the code folder.

The results are summarized in the diagram.
