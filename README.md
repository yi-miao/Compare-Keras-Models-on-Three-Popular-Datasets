This project is about Image Classification in Machine Learning. 

It applies three Keras Sequential models (one simple non-cnn and two cnn) on three popular datasets 
(MNIST, FASHION MNIST and CIFAR 10), and compares the results.
The comparison and analysis focus on  
1. different type of the models, non-cnn vs cnn,
2. different complexity of the models, one convolution layer vs multiple convolution layer,
3. same model on different datasets.

The source code are provided with reference of multiple sources available on-line.

The results are summarized in the diagram.
